            <p>I chose to study Information Technology because, ever since childhood, I've dreamed of creating my own game. While IT isn't entirely focused on game development, it's still a path that brings me closer to my passion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I chose to study at STI after being rejected by PUP, my first-choice school. However, I didn't dwell on the setback. Instead, I embraced it, knowing that God has a greater plan for me. If I wasn't meant to be at PUP, then there must be a purpose for me here at STI."</p>
            <br>
            <p>Speaking of God, I also go to church! I wanted to share this because spreading His word and sharing Christ with others is our great commission after all.</p>
